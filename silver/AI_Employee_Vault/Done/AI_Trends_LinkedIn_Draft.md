**The AI hype era is over. Welcome to the pragmatism era.**

Q1 2026 is redefining how businesses think about AI. Here are the trends that matter:

**1. Agentic AI is real** — AI agents are being embedded directly into enterprise platforms, handling everything from cloud cost optimization to security incident response. Multi-agent systems are the new frontier.

**2. ROI or bust** — Enterprises are done experimenting. 2026 is the "show me the money" year. If your AI initiative can't demonstrate measurable value, it's getting cut.

**3. Smaller models, bigger impact** — Not everything needs GPT-scale compute. Efficient, on-device models running on modest hardware are going mainstream — bringing AI to the edge.

**4. Open-source is shifting the balance** — Chinese AI labs are closing the gap fast. The lag between their releases and Western frontier models? Down to weeks.

**5. AI joins the lab** — From drug discovery to materials science, AI is no longer just summarizing papers — it's generating hypotheses and collaborating with researchers.

The bottom line: the companies winning with AI in 2026 aren't deploying the most models. They're rethinking how decisions, teams, and workflows are organized around AI.

It's a management revolution, not just a tech one.
