## Prompt

i have created a module-3 spec file - Silver Module 3: Plan Generation + Integration with 4 user stories (US-1 Plan Generation, US-2 Silver Integration, US-3 Documentation, US-4 Demo Video)

## Response snapshot

Created specification at specs/silver/module-3/spec.md with 4 user stories, 5 functional requirement groups (plan generation, execution tracking, integration, documentation, demo), non-functional requirements, success criteria, and key entities. Created requirements checklist at specs/silver/module-3/checklists/requirements.md with 29 checkable items across functional, non-functional, user story, and integration categories.

## Outcome

- Impact: Complete spec for Silver Module 3 plan generation and integration
- Tests: None (spec phase)
- Files: 2 files created
- Next prompts: /sp.plan, /sp.tasks, /sp.implement
- Reflection: Module 3 is lighter than Modules 1-2 since most infrastructure exists; focus is on plan generation skill and integration testing

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Checklist structure PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): null
