# Gmail Watcher Tasks Creation

## Summary

Created a comprehensive task breakdown for the Gmail Watcher module with 44 total tasks, including:

- Core implementation tasks organized by user stories
- Comprehensive testing suite integrated throughout the development process
- Clear dependencies and execution order
- Parallel execution opportunities identified
- Tasks designed for incremental implementation with continuous validation

## Key Features

- **44 Total Tasks**: Organized across 12 phases from setup to polish
- **Integrated Testing**: 10 testing tasks (T026-T035) that can run alongside implementation
- **Incremental Approach**: Tasks designed for MVP-first development
- **Quality Assurance**: Unit, integration, and validation tests included
- **Parallel Execution**: Identified opportunities to run tasks in parallel for efficiency

## Ready for Implementation

The task breakdown is ready for the implementation phase with clear milestones and validation points throughout the development process.
